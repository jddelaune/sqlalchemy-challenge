# Data Analysis with SQLAlchemy

The first part of this project uses SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to explore and analyze a dataset of temperature and precipitation data from weather stations in Hawaii.

The second part is a Flask API with routes that return a list of stations, a year's worth of temperature or precipitation observations, or permit the user to input a pair of dates and get the minimum, average, and maximum temperature between the two dates (or between a start date and the end date present in the dataset).
